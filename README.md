This project aims to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques, leveraging environmental factors like pollutant concentrations and weather conditions. The goal is to provide actionable insights for policymakers, environmental agencies, and the public. By employing algorithms such as Linear Regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the project emphasizes feature reduction and predictive accuracy. Evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are used to gauge the model‚Äôs performance. The results offer practical implications for real-time monitoring and air quality management strategies.

## Introduction
### Problem Statement
Air pollution remains a pressing issue worldwide, contributing to respiratory diseases, climate change, and reduced quality of life. The Air Quality Index (AQI) serves as an important metric for monitoring and reporting air quality. Predicting AQI accurately can aid in better decision-making and early interventions. However, traditional methods rely heavily on static statistical models, which often fail to adapt to dynamic environmental changes. Machine learning provides a robust alternative, enabling dynamic and data-driven predictions.

### Project Objectives
1.	To Understand the impact of pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, CO) and weather conditions (e.g., humidity, temperature) on AQI.
2.	Build predictive models using machine learning techniques like Linear Regression.
3.	Optimize model performance by reducing dimensionality using PCA
4.	Evaluate models with statistical rigor and quantitative metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE)
5.	Provide visualizations for better interpretability of results.

### Scope of the Project
This project targets the creation of a scalable and adaptable framework for AQI prediction using historical data. Its implications extend beyond academic exploration to practical applications like urban planning and health risk assessments.
